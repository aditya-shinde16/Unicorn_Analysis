# Unicorn Analysis 

## 📚 About Data

The data for this analysis was obtained from the [Maven Analytics website](https://mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-unicorn-challenge). 

The dataset consists of information on private companies with a valuation exceeding $1 billion as of March 2022. Each record in the dataset includes details such as the company's current valuation, funding information, country of origin, industry, investors, and the founding and unicorn status years of the companies.

The dataset is in the form of a CSV table with a total of 1,074 records, each representing a unique company.

## 🎯 Objective

## 💡 Highlights

## ✏️ Data Wrangling

To ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis, several data wrangling steps were performed:
- Basic Data Exploration
- Removal of Insignificant Columns and Missing Values
- Formatting of Valuation and Funding Columns: Removed "$" and "B" from Valuation and Funding column and casted them as float
- Expansion of Investors Column: The Investors column was expanded into individual rows to facilitate categorical analysis.
